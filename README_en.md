# The Mirrow of Cohesion - A Minecraft Level Tool

This project is expected to be a set of Minecraft level tools using the lastest .Net platform, which are cross-platform, efficient, accurate, and easy to use. The NBT Library is now available, while others are still developing.

I plan to support the lastest Java version of Minecraft first, but may also support Bedrock of old versions if it is needed.

You may incur loss when using these software, but THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, since the project is totally free. Please make proper backups before using.

My email: 2601973667@qq.com  I will constantly pay attention to it.

The sourcecode of the project is published on both Gitee and Github:

Gitee:https://gitee.com/zcm2005/The_Mirror_of_Cohesion

Github:https://github.com/zcm2005/The_Mirror_of_Cohesion

Due to the network, the Github version may delay a little. Please try Gitee first.
